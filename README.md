# Puja Photo Booth — Couple / Shiv / Durga (GitHub Pages Ready)

## Add your overlays
Copy your PNG overlays (with transparent face cutouts) into `assets/` with these exact names:
- overlay-couple.png  (Couple — NO logo inside this file)
- overlay-shiv.png    (Shiv only — include your red logo bottom-right)
- overlay-durga.png   (Durga only — include your red logo bottom-right)

On load, the app asks who is in the photo and loads the matching overlay.

## Host
1) Create a new GitHub repo and upload this folder.
2) Settings → Pages → Deploy from Branch (root). Use the URL on your WordPress site.

## Footer
Every render includes a small caption at the bottom:
“Rendered at sole discretion via Online Photo Booth of www.aerospaceparkbengalis.in”
